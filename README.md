# Intro

I want to build a portfolio website that will show off my software engineering abilities in addition to acting as a place I can post projects that I've worked on, software and otherwise. Below is a list of requirements.

# Requirements

1. The website must be a React app written in Typescript
2. The app will use Vite as the bundler
3. The app will use Material UI as the UI library
4. The app must be developed using a development container
5. The the existing app must live inside a docker container
6. The app will be published and hosted using [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
7. The app must be accessable via a URL containing my name
8. Adding new projects to my website must be quick and easy

# Unknowns

Unfortunately, I do not currently posess the skills needed to simply create this application. I can write Typescript/React with no problem. However, all the other DevOps related requirements to actually make this application visible to anyone other than myself are not things I know how to do. So, here is a list of the skills I need to aquire to make that happen.

- [ ] Learn how to use docker enough that I can create a development container to run and develop this app in
- [ ] Learn how to use Vite
- [ ] Learn how to use Emotion.js in more recent versions of Material UI
- [ ] Learn how to point Vercel at my repository so I can have continuous integration for the entire process
- [ ] Buy a domain name that contains my name
- [ ] Learn how to point that doman name at my instance of this site
